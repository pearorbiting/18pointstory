_Lyndon's Synthesized Symmetric 18-Point Story Structure_

This is a general outline of stories, one based most of all on KM Weiland's Plot Circle. It works like a palindrome; each point relates to its reflection on the other end of the story. Image -> Resolved Image, Trigger -> Peak, Pinch Point -> Sabotage, etc.

Breaking each act of Three-Act Structure into two pieces may help with understanding the longer second act, as in The W Plot and Four-Act Structure.

Also, since everything has a beginning, middle, and end, it seems natural to break the act halves into three, not least because the resulting steps all tend to show up explicitly in one system or another and implicitly in most.

Suggested use is printing the PDF and filling the fields with your own creation.

At first this came together for a visual novel I'm working on.

I hope you find it helpful!
