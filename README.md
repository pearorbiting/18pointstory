_Lyndon's Synthesized Symmetric 18-Point Story Structure_

This is a general outline of stories, but it's based most of all on KM Weiland's Plot Circle. It works like a palindrome, with each point relating to its reflected point on the other end of the story.

Breaking each act in Three-Act Structure into two pieces may help with understanding the longer second act, as in The W Plot and Four-Act Structure.

Also, since everything has a beginning, middle, and end, it seems natural to break the act halves into three, not least because the resulting steps all tend to show up explicitly in one system or another and implicitly in most.

Suggested use is printing the PDF and filling the fields with your own creation.

I hope you find it helpful!
