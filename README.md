_Lyndon's Synthesized Symmetric 18-Point Story Structure_

This is a general outline of stories based most of all on KM Weiland's Plot Circle.

Breaking each act into two pieces, and each piece into three steps, may help with seeing the second act in two parts (The W Plot, Four-Act Structure).

Also, since everything has a beginning, middle, and end, it seems natural to break the act halves into three, not least because the resulting steps all tend to show up explicitly in one system or another and implicitly in most.

Suggested use is printing the PDF and filling the fields with your own creation.

I hope you find it helpful!
